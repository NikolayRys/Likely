```

Instruction for using with webpack provided by @Corey-Maler.

## Setup

After you've installed Likely, you need to setup Likely. First, you need to 
include compiled sources.

With bower:

```html
<!-- Head -->
<link href="bower_components/Likely/release/likely.css" 
      rel="stylesheet">
<!-- End of body -->
<script src="bower_components/Likely/release/likely.js" 
        type="text/javascript"></script>
```

With npm:

```html
<!-- Head -->
<link href="node_modules/ilyabirman-likely/release/likely.css" 
      rel="stylesheet">
<!-- End of body -->
<script src="node_modules/ilyabirman-likely/release/likely.js" 
        type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Or just include files named `likely.css` and `likely.js`.

Then you'll need to create HTML container with `likely` class and list desired 
social networks in child divs:

```html
<div class="likely">
    <div class="facebook">Share</div>
    <div class="twitter">Tweet</div>
    <div class="gplus">+1</div>
    <div class="vkontakte">Share</div>
    <div class="pinterest">Pin</div>
    <div class="odnoklassniki">Share</div>
    <div class="linkedin">Share</div>
</div>
```

Likely supports following social networks:

* `facebook` – Facebook
* `twitter` – Twitter
* `gplus` - Google+
* `vkontakte` – VK
* `pinterest` – Pinterest
* `odnoklassniki` – Odnoklassniki
* `linkedin` – LinkedIn

Also, you can have several Likely button sets on the page. Just create another 
container and set needed options.

## Options

You can set some options on Likely button set via `data-*` attributes:

* `data-url` – URL to share and load counters for
* `data-title` – Page title

There's also social network specific options.

### Twitter

You can set `data-via` attribute on Twitter button to insert username mention 
of this user:

```html
<div class="twitter" data-via="ilyabirman">Tweet</div>
```

### Pinterest

You can set `data-media` attribute include some media file to share on pinterest.
It is suppose to be a URL to media file:

```html
<div class="pinterest" data-media="https://placekitten.com/200/400">Pin</div>
```

## Demo

You can see Likely in action on its [homepage](http://ilyabirman.net/projects/likely/).
