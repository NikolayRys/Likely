* `facebook` ‚Äì Facebook
* `linkedin` ‚Äì LinkedIn

* `pinterest` ‚Äì Pinterest
* `reddit` ‚Äì Reddit
* `telegram` ‚Äì Telegram
* `twitter` ‚Äì Twitter
* `viber` ‚Äì Viber
* `vkontakte` ‚Äì VK
* `whatsapp` ‚Äì WhatsApp

## Get
[Download the last release](https://github.com/NikolayRys/Likely/releases/download/v2.6/ilyabirman-likely-2.6.zip) and move `likely.js` and
`likely.css` to the desired directory.

Or use npm or Bower:

```sh
$ npm install ilyabirman-likely --save
$ bower install ilyabirman-likely --save
```

Also you can use Likely from CDN:

https://unpkg.com/ilyabirman-likely@2/release/likely.min.css
<br>
https://unpkg.com/ilyabirman-likely@2/release/likely.min.js

or

https://unpkg.com/ilyabirman-likely@2/release/likely.css
<br>
https://unpkg.com/ilyabirman-likely@2/release/likely.js

## Setup

Link the files `likely.css` and `likely.js` from the compiled sources. Minified `.min.` versions also can be used for this.

If downloaded directly:
```html
<!-- Head -->
<link href="path/to/likely.css" rel="stylesheet">
<!-- End of body -->
<script src="path/to/likely.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

If installed with npm:

```html
<!-- Head -->
<link href="node_modules/ilyabirman-likely/release/likely.css"
      rel="stylesheet">
<!-- End of body -->
<script src="node_modules/ilyabirman-likely/release/likely.js"
        type="text/javascript"></script>
```

If installed with Bower:

```html
<!-- Head -->
<link href="bower_components/Likely/release/likely.css"
      rel="stylesheet">
<!-- End of body -->
<script src="bower_components/Likely/release/likely.js"
        type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Then, create a `div` with the class `likely` and list necessary social networks:

```html
<div class="likely">
    <div class="facebook">Share</div>
    <div class="twitter">Tweet</div>
    <div class="vkontakte">Share</div>
    <div class="pinterest">Pin</div>
    <div class="odnoklassniki">Like</div>
    <div class="telegram">Send</div>
    <div class="linkedin">Share</div>
    <div class="whatsapp">Send</div>
    <div class="viber">Send</div>
    <div class="reddit">Share</div>
</div>
```

If you need several Likely widgets on the page, just create another `div` with the class `likely` and list the social networks in it.

### Using as a CommonJS module

Likely can be used as a CommonJS module, so you can use it within webpack or browserify build systems.

First, install Likely using npm:

```sh
$ npm install ilyabirman-likely --save
```

Then, use it as CommonJS module somewhere in your program:

```js
var likely = require('ilyabirman-likely');

// Finds all the widgets in the DOM and initializes them
likely.initiate();
```

## Service options
You can configure Likely by specifying `data-*` attributes on a button group with the `likely` class or on the button of a specific service.

Top-level options are passed down to all the services. They can also be overridden on an individual service tag.
* `data-url` ‚Äì URL to share and load counters for, defaults to the current page URL. ‚ö† Specify the full URL with the protocol ‚Äì like in `https://ilyabirman.com` ‚Äì because some social networks don‚Äôt recognize the partial one.
* `data-title` ‚Äì Text that will be added to the shared URL. Defaults to the page title.
```html
<div class="likely" data-url="https://github.com/ilyabirman/Likely" data-title="My page">
    <!-- list of serivces -->
</div>
```

In 2020 most social networks rely on what is called [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/) to extract the information about shared links.
Below there is more information regarding how individual services support it,
but it's highly recommended to set up the proper <meta> tags for your page, to work in conjunction with Likely.

## Services

## Additional info
### Reinitialize configuration on change data attributes
If you need to dynamically change the widget's configuration, you can re-initialize it:

```javascript
// Use global object, created by the library
likely.initiate();
// If you need to refresh the counters, pass the corresponding param,
// but be aware that it will issue xhr calls to all the relevant services.
likely.initiate({forceUpdate: true});
```

### How to disable the automatic counters
Counters are enabled by default, but there are two ways to disable them:
* To add `data-counters` attribute on the upper `likely` div with `"no"`value to disable all counters.
* Another option is to supply a custom value for `data-counter` attribute of the specific services.
Likely won't do an API request for those services and just display the given value instead.
It can be used when you want to save user's traffic and obtain value through some other means,
for example through the backend in a centralized manner.

### Accessibility Settings
To make buttons accessible for keyboard navigation and screen readers add `tabindex`, `role` and `aria-label` attributes:
```html
<div class="likely">
    <div class="facebook" tabindex="0" role="link" aria-label="Share on Facebook">Share</div>
    <div class="twitter" tabindex="0" role="link" aria-label="Tweet on Twitter">Tweet</div>
    <!-- The same for each services -->
</div>
```

### Custom button
It's possible to add a custom button into Likely's row of buttons.
Let's assume that you have a 16x16 pixels image and a link to the service which you want to share to.
```html
<div class="likely__widget">
    <!-- List of other services -->
    <a class="likely__button" style="color:black" href="https://new.service.share.url">
        <img class="likely__icon" alt="" src="https://url.of/the/image/16x16.png">
        Post
    </a>
</div>
```

### Supported browsers
We support IE 10+, Safari 9+ and the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Likely might work in the older versions too but we don‚Äôt maintain the compatibility on purpose.

### Deprecations
In version 3.0 the following is going to be changed:
1. Classes `likely-visible` and `likely-ready` will be merged into just `likely-ready`, so please don't rely on `likely-visible` to test the presence.
2. Unrecognized params passed to the services will be ignored.
3. Old initialization method will be removed.
4. Likely buttons will be changed from <div> to <button> tag.

As of now, there are deprecation warnings implemented for all the above.
