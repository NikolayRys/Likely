Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 28.05.2024

1. Introduction
Welcome to Likely. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our open-source JavaScript library to interact with various social network APIs. Our library serves as a thin layer over these APIs, allowing developers to query them without collecting or storing any personal data.

2. Information We Collect
*We do not collect, store, or share any personal information through our JavaScript library*. All data interactions are strictly between your application and the respective social network APIs.

3. Use of Social Network APIs
Our library facilitates requests to various social network APIs, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others. We do not have access to the data exchanged between your application and these social networks. Please refer to the respective data policies of each social network for more information on how they handle your data. Likely is an open-source library that does not have any data storage and thus does not collect any user data at all. However, the data can be collected by the third-party providers whose buttons you include in your application. We encourage you to consult with their data collecting policies to understand how they process your data.

4. External Links
Our library may contain links to external websites, including social networks. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external sites you visit.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
